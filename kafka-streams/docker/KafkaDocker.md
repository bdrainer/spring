# Running Kafka Locally

## Overview 
The docker-compose.yml contains the Confluent suite of applications for Kafka.  You could run all containers 
and test out what they offer.  See the quickstart link below.

To run the 3 services in this application you only need to run Kafka.  To start the Kafka container run
`docker-compose up -d broker`.  This starts Kafka and exposes it on port `9092`.
