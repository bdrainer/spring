# Spring

Projects using Spring Boot.  My goal is to learn aspects of Java and the Spring Boot ecosystem.

## Projects

**identity-manager** : A project using DynamoDB.  The repository layer is written in a way that resembles Spring Data.  Entities are annotated similar to how JPA and MongoDB Spring Data entities are annotated.
